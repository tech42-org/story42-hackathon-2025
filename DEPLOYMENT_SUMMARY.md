## 🎯 Deployment Plan

### Phase 1: Continue Development (Current)
**Status:** ✅ **READY NOW**

```bash
# Run development server
export AWS_PROFILE=sandbox-dev
source venv/bin/activate
python src/api/app.py

# Or use quick-start script
./start-dev.sh
```

**Features:**
- Local SQLite database
- File-based storage
- No AWS costs (except Bedrock API calls)
- Instant iteration

---

### Phase 2: Prepare for Production (Next)
**Status:** 📋 **READY TO IMPLEMENT**

#### Step 1: Create Terraform Backend (5 minutes)

```bash
cd terraform

# Set AWS credentials
export AWS_PROFILE=your-prod-profile

# Bootstrap (creates S3 + DynamoDB for state)
./bootstrap.sh
```

**What it creates:**
- S3 bucket: `story-generator-terraform-state`
- DynamoDB table: `terraform-state-lock`
- Versioning, encryption, and access controls

---

#### Step 2: Deploy to AWS Dev (15 minutes)

```bash
# Deploy infrastructure
./deploy.sh dev apply
```

**What gets created:**
- VPC with public/private subnets
- DynamoDB table for sessions
- S3 buckets for stories & images
- ECS Fargate cluster (1 small task)
- Application Load Balancer
- CloudWatch log groups
- IAM roles with least-privilege

**Monthly cost:** ~$30

---

#### Step 3: Build Docker Image (5 minutes)

```bash
# Update Dockerfile for production
# Build and push to ECR

docker build -t story-generator:latest .

# Push to ECR (created by Terraform)
aws ecr get-login-password | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin ${ACCOUNT}.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com

docker tag story-generator:latest ${ACCOUNT}.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/story-generator:latest
docker push ${ACCOUNT}.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/story-generator:latest
```

---

#### Step 4: Deploy to Production (30 minutes)

```bash
# Deploy production infrastructure
./deploy.sh prod apply
```

**What gets created:**
- Everything from dev PLUS:
  - Multi-AZ deployment (3 availability zones)
  - NAT Gateway for high availability
  - Auto-scaling (2-10 ECS tasks)
  - CloudFront for frontend CDN
  - Enhanced monitoring
  - DynamoDB backups
  - S3 versioning

**Monthly cost:** ~$150-300 (scales with usage)

---

### Phase 3: Add Enhancements (Future)

#### Cognito Authentication
- User registration and login
- JWT token management
- Protected API endpoints
- User session history

**Implementation:** See `ENHANCEMENT_GUIDE.md`

#### Image Generation
- AWS Bedrock Titan Image Generator
- S3 storage for images
- CloudFront CDN delivery
- Image gallery in frontend

**Implementation:** See `ENHANCEMENT_GUIDE.md`

#### Demo Notebooks
- Jupyter notebooks showcasing features
- Web search demo
- Multi-agent pipeline demo
- Storage operations demo

**Implementation:** See `ENHANCEMENT_GUIDE.md`

---

## 🔄 Migration Strategy

### Switching from Dev to Prod

**Application Code Changes:** ✅ **NONE REQUIRED!**

Your application automatically adapts based on environment variables:

```python
# In your code (already implemented)
storage_mode = os.getenv('STORAGE_MODE', 'sqlite')

if storage_mode == 'sqlite':
    # Use local SQLite + filesystem
else:
    # Use DynamoDB + S3
```

**Just change environment variables:**

| Variable | Dev | Prod |
|----------|-----|------|
| `STORAGE_MODE` | `sqlite` | `aws` |
| `SESSION_TABLE_NAME` | N/A | `story-generator-sessions-prod` |
| `STORY_BUCKET_NAME` | N/A | `story-generator-stories-prod-{account}` |
| `IMAGE_BUCKET_NAME` | N/A | `story-generator-images-prod-{account}` |

**Terraform sets these automatically!** ✨

## 💰 Cost Comparison

| Environment | Setup | Monthly | Use Case |
|-------------|-------|---------|----------|
| **Local Dev** | $0 | $0 | Development |
| **AWS Dev** | $5 | $30 | Testing on AWS |
| **AWS Staging** | $10 | $75 | Pre-prod validation |
| **AWS Prod** | $20 | $150-300 | Live production |

**Bedrock API costs** (all environments): ~$0.50-2.00 per story generated

### Common Issues
1. **"State locked"** → Someone else is deploying, wait or `terraform force-unlock`
2. **"No such bucket"** → Run `./bootstrap.sh` first
3. **"Permission denied"** → Check AWS IAM permissions
4. **"Task failing to start"** → Check CloudWatch logs: `/ecs/story-generator-{env}`
